class Registry(dict):
    '''
    A helper class for managing registering modules, it extends a dictionary
    and provides a register functions.

    Eg. creeting a registry:
        some_registry = Registry({"default": default_module})

    There're two ways of registering new modules:
    1): normal way is just calling register function:
        def foo():
            ...
        some_registry.register("foo_module", foo)
    2): used as decorator when declaring the module:
        @some_registry.register("foo_module")
        @some_registry.register("foo_modeul_nickname")
        def foo():
            ...

    Access of module is just like using a dictionary, eg:
        f = some_registry["foo_modeul"]
    '''
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(Registry, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    def register(self, module_name, module=None):
        # used as function call
        if module is not None:
            _register_generic(self, module_name, module)
            return

        # used as decorator
        def register_fn(fn):
            _register_generic(self, module_name, fn)
            return fn

        return register_fn
